1. Installation instructions
---------------------------
a) You will need a NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 1.3
or higher to use fluam. You don't need any GPU to compile 
and modify the code.

b) Third-party software: you will need the CUDA compiler
nvcc, CUDA libraries, and the cutil.h files that you can obtain
with the NVIDIA SDK package.

c) Edit the file fluam/bin/MakefileHeader
to include the right path to the NVIDIA SDK files
and the HydroGrid code in case you have it. 
Set the right architecture for your GPU in 
"NVCCFLAGS".

d) Move to fluam/bin/ and type 
make

e) To speed up the compilation process see fluam/work/README

2. Use
------
To run fluam type
fluam data.main

data.main is a file with the option for the simulation, look
fluam/bin/data.main for the options.
