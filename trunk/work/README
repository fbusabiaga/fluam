Part of fluam's code is compiled for the CPU while most part of
the code is compiled to run on the GPU. The compilation of the
GPU part of the code can take around 3 or 4 minutes which results 
too long when developing the code. To speed up the compilation it 
is necessary to reduce the number of lines of the GPU code; since 
fluam includes several schemes, while working with one of them it 
is not necessary to include the code for the other schemes. 
To speed up the compilation follow the next steps:

0) Move to the new working directory 
   cd fluam/work/bin/

1) Copy Makefiles to the new working directory
   rsync -avz ../../bin/Make* ./
   rsync -avz ../../bin/makefile ./

2) Copy source code, excluding the ".svn" directory, "scheme*" and "GPU.cu" files,
   to the new ``src'' working directory
   rsync -avz --exclude ".svn/" --exclude "scheme*" --exclude "GPU.cu" ../../src/ ../src/

3) Copy the "scheme*" file that you are going to use to the work directory.
   For example, if you are working with the incompressible scheme
   rsync -avz ../../src/schemeIncompressible.cu ../src/

4) Edit the file "fluam/work/src/GPU.cu". Uncomment the lines
   of the scheme you plan to use. For example, if you plan to use
   the incompressible scheme, uncomment the lines between
   "//SchemeIncompressible" and "//SchemeIncompressibleBoundary".

5) Try to compile, type "make". Typically, the compilation
   will fail because the compiler is not able to find some
   source files; you will see errors messages like 
   "undefined reference to FUNCTION.NAME" or 
   "error: identifier IDENTIFIER.NAME is undefined".
   You will have to uncomment some more lines in
   "GPU.cu" to make that files available to the compiler. 
   In general, the names of the files (included in "GPU.cu") and the names
   of the functions are similar and therefore they will be easy to find.
   If you do not know where a function or identifier is defined, try the spell
   find ../src/ -name "*cu" -print0 | xargs -0 grep FUNCTION.NAME

6) Once all the required files in "GPU.cu" are uncommented, compile
   the code. Now, the compilation process should be faster than before.
