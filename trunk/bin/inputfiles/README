INFORMATION FOR BONDED FORCES:
It's possible link particles between them or to a fixed point in the simulation
box. The new terms will be harmonic potentials with equilibrium length r0

V(r) = 0.5 * k * (rij -r0)^2

To use this forces in the inputfile "data.main" add the line

bondedForces            fileBondedForces.dat

Where fileBondedForces.dat is a file with the information of the bonded
forces (it is possible to use a different file name). The format of the file is the
following (see examples below)

number_bonds_particle_particle
index1          index2           kSpring           r0

number_bonds_particle_particle: This is twice the number of bonds between
particles.

index1:  one of the particles in the bond. They should be sort from lower  to
higher index.

kSpring: the spring constant

r0: the equilibrium length

number_bonds_fixed_points: number of bonds between particles and fixed points.

index1: the particle in the bond

kSpring: spring constant

r0: equilibrium length

x, y, z : coordinates of the fixed point or the potential center.
